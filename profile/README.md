## andreswebs-public-images

Hello, this is a place where I collect my public container images. 

These are images that I use regularly for my own work, and I share them here for easy reference and to benefit others - as I have benefited a lot from copied code from the web - but they come with no guarantees. 

They may be buggy or insecure, and I assume no responsability for anyone else's uses, so beware and do your own due dilligence before using them.

The images in this organization are released under [The Unlicense](UNLICENSE.md).

They are published to the [Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/andreswebs) and can be used as `public.ecr.aws/andreswebs/<image-name>:latest`.

Enjoy!
